\opening{Dear Sir or Madam:}

I would like to be considered for the position of Program Manager for the Cold
Atom Program.  I have worked in the theory of cold-atom interferometry since
2001.   In 2007 began working with the Cold Atom program as a post doctoral
student.  I have continued to work with the Cold Atom program.  I am now the
group's longest serving member.  

I have been providing theoretical support for Matthew Squires' experiments since to 2004
when we were both graduate students.  This excellent working relationship puts
me in a unique position to understand the customer's needs, and manage the
daily activities of the Cold Atom team.   As the theorist, my main role in the
Cold Atom team has been to develop the requirements for future projects.  Due to my
experience in with the group, I am well suited to provide an interface between 
the customer and SDL's larger team of engineers, managers, tester, technicians,
and support personnel.  

I have experience working as a contractor and government employee, which gives me
insight into the DoD-contractor relationship.  I have experience with Windows,
Linux and software development.  

Please find attached a copy of my curriculum veta, list of references, and
publications that detail my research experience.  I look forward to hearing
from you with regards to this position. 

\closing{Sincerely, \\
